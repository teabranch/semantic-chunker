The Python `chunker.py` and the JavaScript `lambda-nodejs-base.mjs` differ significantly primarily because of the direct instructions provided in `initial-instruction.md` and the natural consequences of translating logic between languages and changing core dependencies.

Here are the key reasons for the differences:

1.  **Language and Idioms**:
    *   The most obvious difference is the language itself (Python vs. JavaScript). This means different syntax, standard libraries, and common programming patterns.
    *   For example, Python uses `class DocumentChunker:` with `__init__` for the constructor, while JavaScript uses `export class DocumentChunker { constructor() ... }`. Error handling uses `try...except` in Python versus `try...catch` in JavaScript.

2.  **Embedding Generation**:
    *   **Original (JS)**: Relied on a `generateEmbedding` function imported from `./bedrock.mjs`. This suggests it was designed to use a specific service (likely AWS Bedrock) with a particular model (`amazon.nova-pro-v1:0` by default).
    *   **New (Python)**: Was explicitly instructed to use the OpenAI library. This required:
        *   Importing `openai`.
        *   Initializing `OpenAI` and `AsyncOpenAI` clients.
        *   Allowing configuration for `openai_model`, `openai_api_key`, and `openai_base_url`.
        *   Implementing `_generate_embedding_async` and `_generate_embedding_sync` methods to call the OpenAI API.

3.  **Chunking Logic in `processDocument`**:
    *   **Original (JS)**: The `processDocument` method in the JavaScript version had a specific way of handling embeddings for chunks. It maintained `currentEmbedding` which was the embedding of the *last sentence added* to `currentChunk`. When a chunk was finalized (due to low similarity with the next sentence), it stored this `currentEmbedding` (which was the embedding of the last sentence of that chunk). For the very last chunk after the loop, it would then generate a new embedding based on all sentences joined in that final chunk.
    *   **New (Python)**: The Python `process_document` (and its synchronous counterpart) was implemented to generate an embedding for the *entire text of the current chunk* (`" ".join(current_chunk_sentences_list)`) each time a chunk is finalized. This is a common approach where the chunk's embedding represents the aggregated meaning of all its sentences. This change was made to align with a more standard interpretation of creating semantically coherent chunks where the embedding represents the whole chunk.

4.  **Similarity Calculation**:
    *   **Original (JS)**: Used basic array methods (`reduce`, `Math.sqrt`) for dot product and magnitude calculation.
    *   **New (Python)**: Uses `numpy` for vector operations (`np.dot`, `np.linalg.norm`), which is standard in Python for numerical tasks and can be more efficient for array mathematics.

5.  **Sentence Splitting (`split_into_sentences`)**:
    *   While the core regular expression was adapted, the surrounding logic for handling edge cases (e.g., an empty document or a document that doesn't split into multiple sentences) and cleaning the sentences (stripping whitespace) might have slight idiomatic differences between the Python and JavaScript implementations. The Python version also explicitly filters out empty strings after splitting.

6.  **Asynchronous and Synchronous Operations**:
    *   **Original (JS)**: Provided an `async processDocument` method.
    *   **New (Python)**: Provides both an asynchronous `process_document` and a synchronous `process_document_sync` method for flexibility.

7.  **Configuration and Initialization**:
    *   **Original (JS)**: The constructor took `modelId` (for Bedrock) and `similarityThreshold`.
    *   **New (Python)**: The `__init__` method takes `openai_model`, `similarity_threshold`, and also `openai_api_key` and `openai_base_url` to configure the OpenAI client.

8.  **Logging**:
    *   **Original (JS)**: Used an optional `this.logger` passed in the config.
    *   **New (Python)**: Uses Python's built-in `logging` module, with a default logger configured if none is provided.

In essence, the Python version is not just a direct line-by-line translation but a rewrite that incorporates a different core dependency (OpenAI library instead of a Bedrock-specific one) and refines some of the logic (like chunk embedding generation) to align with common practices for the new library and language. The goal was to fulfill the requirements of `initial-instruction.md`, which included switching to OpenAI and Python.
